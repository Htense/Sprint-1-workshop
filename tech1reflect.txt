In a couple of sentences, how would you describe the command line in plain English? 	
It is like a very dark room version of my Mac, but once i get the hang of it I know I will be able to see faster n the dark than i usually can in the light.

Can you think of an analogy for it?
Same as above - It is similar to excel, feels like you are under cover or in the vents.

Did you stick to the timebox guidelines? If not, what change would you make next time?

Absolutely not! I havnt studied for a while so i just kept playing until i got it - have been working on this for a few hours, very satisfying once I got it.

Name 5 commands you used, and what they do

ls - List Directories - / what is in the room?
cd - Change Directory - cd .. go back one
mkdir - Make directory
nano - (create or oopen to edit a text file or html)
pwd - print working directory / find where i am,
